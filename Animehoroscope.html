            <h1>HOROSCOPE </h1>
            <p>A horoscope (or other commonly used names for the horoscope in English include natal chart, astrological
                chart, astro-chart, celestial map, sky-map, star-chart, cosmogram, vitasphere, radical chart, radix,
                chart wheel or simply chart) is an astrological chart or diagram representing the positions of the Sun,
                Moon, planets, astrological aspects and sensitive angles at the time of an event, such as the moment of
                a person's birth. The word horoscope is derived from the Greek words ōra and scopos meaning "time" and
                "observer" (horoskopos, pl. horoskopoi, or "marker(s) of the hour"). It is used as a method of
                divination regarding events relating to the point in time it represents, and it forms the basis of the
                horoscopic traditions of astrology.
                <br>
                <br>
                In common usage, horoscope often refers to an astrologer's interpretation, usually based on a system of
                solar Sun sign astrology; based strictly on the position of the Sun at the time of birth, or on the
                calendar significance of an event, as in Chinese astrology. In particular, many newspapers and magazines
                carry predictive columns, written in prose that may be written more for increasing readership than tied
                directly to the Sun or other aspects of the solar system, allegedly based on celestial influences in
                relation to the zodiacal placement of the Sun on the month of birth, cusp (2 days before or after any
                particular sign, an overlap), or decant (the month divided into 3 ten-day periods) of the person's month
                of birth, identifying the individual's Sun sign or "star sign" based on the tropical zodiac
                <br>
                <br>
                In Hindu astrology, birth charts are called kuṇḍali which are claimed to be based on movement of stars
                and moon. Auspicious events and rituals are started after checking the kuṇḍali of a person including the
                marriage in which the birth charts of the boy and girl are matched.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are no scientific studies that have shown support for the accuracy of horoscopes, and the methods
                used to make interpretations are pseudo-scientific. In modern scientific framework no known interaction
                exists that could be responsible for the transmission of the alleged influence between a person and the
                position of stars in the sky at the moment of birth.In all tests completed, keeping strict methods to
                include a control group and proper blinding between experimenters and subjects, horoscopes have shown no
                effect beyond pure chance. Furthermore, some psychological tests have shown that it is possible to
                construct personality descriptions and foretelling generic enough to satisfy most members of a large
                audience simultaneously, referred to as the Forer or Barnum effect.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The horoscope serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific location at a particular moment in
                time. In most applications the perspective is geocentric (heliocentric astrology being one exception).
                The positions of the actual planets (including Sun and Moon) are placed in the chart, along with those
                of purely calculated factors such as the lunar nodes, the house cusps including the midheaven and the
                ascendant, zodiac signs, fixed stars and the lots. Angular relationships between the planets themselves
                and other points, called aspects, are typically determined. The emphasis and interpretation of these
                factors vary with tradition. This means however the stars were placed at the time of birth for a person
                shows their characteristics and personality, including weakness. It is very similar to the Chinese
                Zodiac.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>The Latin word horoscopus, ultimately from Greek ὡρόσκοπος "nativity, horoscope", "observer of the hour
                [of birth]", from ὥρα "time, hour" and σκόπος "observer, watcher". In Middle English texts from the 11th
                century, the word appears in the Latin form and is anglicized to horoscope in Early Modern English. The
                noun horoscopy for "casting of horoscopes" has been in use since the 17th century (OED). In Greek,
                ὡρόσκοπος in the sense of "ascendant" – not only of the time of someone's birth, but more generally of
                any significant event – and ὡροσκοπία "observation of the ascendant" is in use since Ptolemy
                (Tetrabiblos 33, 75).</p>

            <h3>Concepts in Western astrology</h3>
            <nav>

                <li>The native is the subject of the event (a birth, for example) being charted at a particular time and
                    place, and is considered to be at the centre of the celestial sphere.</li>
                <li>The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere onto which the zodiac, constellations and planets are
                    projected.</li>
                <li>The plane of the equator is the plane of the Earth's projected into space.</li>
                <li>The plane of the ecliptic is defined by the orbits of the earth and the For practical purposes the
                    plane of the equator and the plane of the ecliptic maintain a constant inclination to each other of
                    approximately 23.5°.</li>
                <li>The plane of the horizon is centred on the native and is tangential to the earth at that poin
                    In a sphere whose radius is infinitely large, this plane may be treated as nearly equivalent to the
                    parallel
                    plane with its centre at the Earth's centre. This greatly simplifies the geometry of the horoscope
                    but doe
                    s not take into account that the native is in motion. Some writers on astrology have thus considered
                    the
                    effects of , but most would agree that (apart from that of the moon) they are relatively minor.</li>
                <hr>
                <h3> Angles</h3>
                <p>There are four primary angles in the horoscope. These are, in order of power:</p>
                <li>First House (Ascendant – East Angle)</li>
                <li>Tenth House (Midheaven, or Medium Coeli (M.C.) – North Angle)</li>
                <li>Seventh House (Descendant – West Angle)</li>
                <li>Fourth House (Imum Coeli or I.C. – South Angle)</li>
                <p>The ascendant is the easternmost or sunrise point where the ecliptic and horizon intersect; the
                    ascendant and the midheaven are considered the most important angles in the horoscope by the vast
                    majority of astrologers. In most systems of house division, the ascendant is the cusp of the 1st
                    house and the midheaven is the cusp of the 10th house. The placement of the planetary ruler of the
                    ascendant called the Chart Ruler is also considered to be significant. The point in the west
                    diametrically opposing the ascendant is called the descendant, normally the cusp of the 7th house;
                    and the point opposing the M.C. is the cusp of the 4th house, the northernmost point of the chart,
                    called the Imum Coeli or I.C.

                    In creating a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally placed at the "nine o'clock" position on the
                    left-hand side of the chart wheel (though traditional rectangular chart formats need not follow this
                    convention). During the course of a day, because of the Earth's rotation, the entire circle of the
                    ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This movement provides us
                    with the term rising sign, which is the sign of the zodiac rising over the eastern horizon at the
                    moment of birth. The point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon at the
                    time is called the Midheaven, or Medium Coeli (M.C.), placed at the "twelve o'clock position"
                    effectively where the Sun would be if the birth time was midday.
                </p>

                <h3>The Zodiac</h3>
                <li>The Zodiac, or "circle of animals" is a zone or belt in space projected onto the celestial sphere
                    through which, from our viewpoint, the planets move. A symbolic geometric construction around 15 to
                    18 degrees wide, it is divided into 12 signs, each of 30 degrees longitude (making 360 degrees in
                    all), with the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, as its middle line. The tropical zodiac used
                    by most Western astrologers has its beginning at the exact moment that the Sun crosses the celestial
                    equator and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries. Some Western astrologers use the sidereal zodiac
                    favored by Indian ("Jyotish") astrologers, which is based more closely on actual positions of
                    constellations in the heavens, as opposed to the tropical zodiac, which is a moveable format based
                    on the seasons.
                    <br><br>
                    The tropical zodiac defines the vernal point (the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere) as
                    the first degree of Aries, but the sidereal zodiac allows it to precess. Many people are confused
                    regarding the difference between the sidereal zodiac and the tropical zodiac signs. Because of a
                    "wobble" in the Earth's axis of rotation over a period of about 26,000 years (often called a "great
                    year"), the rate at which the vernal equinox precesses in the heavens is approximately 0 deg, 0 min,
                    50.23 seconds a year, drifting by one degree every 72 years. Precession of the equinoxes thus occurs
                    at a rate of roughly 5 arc minutes of a degree every 6 years. The tropical signs relate to the
                    seasons and not the stars. Here is an example: a person born on, say August 28, 2002, would come to
                    understand that their Sun sign was in Virgo according to Western astrology (conventional Sun sign
                    dates August 23, to September 22, of every year), but Sun on that same calendar date of the year
                    2002 was in the constellation Leo (where it had been since August 10, 2002, and would remain until
                    September 15, when it would then finally cross into Virgo).
                    <br><br>
                    It is worth pointing out that the sidereal signs and the tropical signs are both geometrical
                    conventions of 30° each, whereas the zodiacal constellations are pictorial representations of
                    mythological figures projected onto the celestial sphere based on patterns of visible star
                    groupings, none of which occupy precisely 30° of the ecliptic. So constellations and signs are not
                    the same, although for historical reasons they might have the same names.
                </li><br>
                <li>The sun sign is the sign of the zodiac in which the sun is located for the native. This is the
                    single astrological fact familiar to most people. If an event occurs at sunrise the ascendant and
                    sun sign will be the same; other rising signs can then be estimated at approximately two-hour
                    intervals from there.<br>
                </li><br>
                <li>A cusp is the boundary between two signs or houses. For some, the cusp includes a small portion of
                    the two signs or houses under consideration.</li>
                <h3>Houses</h3>
                <li>The houses are a series of twelve divisions of the plane of the ecliptic. Astrologers have devised
                    many systems of calculating these house divisions. In the case of the equal house system the
                    ecliptic is divided into twelve equal houses of 30° each. The first house begins at the ascendant
                    and the others are numbered counterclockwise from that point. The first six are therefore below the
                    horizon, and the other six are above. The positions of these houses remain fixed relative to the
                    native. The signs and planets all move through the twelve houses during the course of a day, and the
                    planets move through the signs over the course of months or years.</li>
